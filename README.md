# Monte-Carlo-simulation
An assignment in the course "Physics and mathematics methods studio" where I implemented Monte-Carlo simulation in my MATLAB code to determine how many cashiers the bank should have to keep the queue length at a reasonable level.

Assignment:
"Customers arrive at the bank randomly, with the time between two consecutive arrivals following an exponential distribution with a mean of 3 minutes (see Appendix 3).
The service time for each customer at a cashier follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 5 minutes. The number of cashiers is denoted by the variable k.
Upon arriving at the bank, a new customer proceeds to a cashier if one is available; otherwise, they join the queue if all cashiers are occupied. Once a customer's service is completed, they leave the bank."
